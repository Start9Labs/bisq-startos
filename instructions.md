# Instructions for Bisq

Welcome to Bisq, a decentralized exchange that allows you to trade cryptocurrencies in a true sovereign way. Here's how to get started:

Configure Bisq by following these steps:

1. Click on the **"Config"** button within Bisq service.
2. Save default values or make any necessary changes to the following settings:
   - **Bisq Title**
   - **Password**
3. Click on the **"Save"** button to apply the configuration changes.

**Note:** The default username for Bisq is **abc**, and you have the option to change the password at any time.

Once Bisq is configured, you can choose to run it either from a web browser or using an RDP client. For mobile users, it is highly recommended to use an RDP client for optimal convenience and performance.

## Running Bisq from a web browser:

Running Bisq from a web browser is possible but may provide a suboptimal experience on mobile devices.

To run Bisq from a web browser, follow these steps:

1. Launch the Bisq App by clicking on the **"LAUNCH UI"** button within Bisq. This will open Bisq in your default web browser.
2. After launching the Bisq App, you will be prompted to enter the "abc" username and associated password.

**Note:** Within the Bisq interface, you will find a black dot on the middle left part of the screen. This dot provides convenient features such as a Copy & Paste field, On-Screen Keyboard, File Manager, and Fullscreen buttons. **(During the login screen, the option to copy and paste is not available)**

## Running Bisq using an RDP client (Recommended for Mobile Users):

Using an RDP client is the preferred method for mobile users as it offers a more optimized and user-friendly experience.

To run Bisq using an RDP client, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that your RDP client can handle SOCKS5 proxy settings. We recommend using [Parallels RAS](https://www.parallels.com/products/ras/download/client/) for desktop and **RD Client** for mobile as clients for accessing the Bisq app through Tor.
2. Connect to the .onion address provided by Bisq > Interfaces using an RDP client.
3. Log in with the `abc` username and the associated password.

## Using Bisq

The first time you use Bisq, you will be prompted to read and agree to the user agreement. Please take the time to review it.

It may take a few moments for Bisq to open as it connects to the Tor network and syncs with Bisq's peer-to-peer trading network. Please be patient while the synchronization process completes.

Once Bisq is fully synced, you are all set to start trading! If you have any questions or need help, you can refer to the Bisq documentation at https://bisq.wiki/.

Happy and safe trading!
